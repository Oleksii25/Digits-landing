# info
1. Working on this project expanded my knowledge in CSS, HTML5. I actively used the BEM methodology.Developed the architecture of the project, which allowed distributing the code into blocks and made it possible to reuse the blocks in other places. Applied jquery technology for the menu. Made the site responsive and flexible. Many elements interact with the user, which attracts his attention.
2. Used here HTML5, CSS3, SASS(SCSS), jQuery;
